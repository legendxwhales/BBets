# Introduction

<!--In this section you explain what you are trying to show.  Where did the data come from?  What is the research or other question you are trying to answer?!-->

 At the first day of class there are 35 students in Math Statistics class and professor Brownlow always proposes this bet to his students "I will wager $2 to your bet of $1 that at least two people in today's class have  the same birthday.  He tells me he has made that bet 637 times so far. Where do you think his profits are? Discuss this in a markdown document
 
Report git commit structure:
There are 3 questions and there should be at least 3 separate commits, at least one dealing with each of the 3 questions.
1. What are the fair odds for a bet on matching birthdays in a 35 person class.
2. For what size class is a 2:1 odds bet fair.
3. How much money would Brownlow be expected to end up with if the bets went as described.

## Our strategy is to build a Function and the use it to answer the three questions. 

The function will be given a class_size by number of students, odds, and Number_of_times brownlow made the bet.  It will give you back how much Brownlows earnings were. We will use it to answer our three questions below. If you can, improve this function by giving default values to some of its inputs. 

# In the class and payoff as described  If you highered 40 brownlow substitute teachers to do the same thing that Brownlow did then.
## what is their average earnings
## the standard deviation and a 95% confidence interval for their earnings?

To find fair odds I solved the closed form equation 𝑝 𝑆 − ( 1 − 𝑝 ) 𝐵 = 0 pS−(1−p)B=0 for 𝐵 B, yielding 𝐵 fair = 𝑆 ⋅ 𝑝 / ( 1 − 𝑝 ) B fair ​ =S⋅p/(1−p). For a 35-student class this gives 𝐵 fair ≈ $ 4.39 B fair ​ ≈$4.39 when the student pays $1 — so Brownlow's offered $2:1 is favorable to him. To quantify expected winnings over 637 bets I used the single-bet mean and variance (derived above) and applied the CLT: total ≈ Normal(mean = 𝑛 𝜇 nμ, sd = 𝑛 V a r ( 𝑋 ) nVar(X) ​ ). The resulting 95% analytic confidence interval is the mean ±1.96×sd; a Monte-Carlo simulation of the full betting process gives an empirical CI which confirms the analytic interval.

# What are the fair odds? Use manipulation of odds in the function to tune Brownlows earnings to zero. 


<!--Decide on your methods:  In this section explain the approach you will take to attack the issue --- how will you decide on a likely estimate of professor Brownlow's earnings or losses after 637 bets. Also explain how you construct a 95% confidence interval about your estimate of his winnings !-->

To determine the fair odds for Brownlow’s birthday bet, we first calculated the probability that at least two people in a 35-person class share a birthday. Using the standard birthday-problem formula, this probability is about 81%, meaning the event occurs far more often than not. We then used a simple expected-value approach: Brownlow wins the student’s $1 whenever there is a match and loses his wager whenever there is no match. By setting Brownlow’s expected earnings equal to zero, we solved for the payout that would make the bet fair. This showed that instead of risking only $2, Brownlow would need to risk about $4.39 per $1 bet to break even in the long run. We verified this using both a closed-form calculation and Monte-Carlo simulations, which also allowed us to construct a 95% confidence interval for his total winnings across 637 bets. Under Brownlow’s current 2:1 payout, the expected value remains strongly positive, demonstrating that the existing odds heavily favor him.

<!--Explain and display the results of your method of coming up with the estimate of professor Brownlows betting profits!-->

To find the class size that makes Brownlow’s current 2:1 wager fair, I set the single-bet expected value to zero: with Brownlow risking $2 and a student risking $1 the EV per bet is 𝐸 = 3 𝑝 − 2 E=3p−2, so fairness requires 𝑝 = 2 / 3 p=2/3 where 𝑝 p is the probability at least two students share a birthday. Using the closed-form birthday formula 𝑝 ( 𝑛 ) = 1 − ∏ 𝑘 = 0 𝑛 − 1 365 − 𝑘 365 p(n)=1−∏ k=0 n−1 ​ 365 365−k ​ and searching over integer class sizes yields that the smallest class size with 𝑝 ≥ 2 / 3 p≥2/3 is 29 (for 𝑛 = 28 n=28, 𝑝 ≈ 0.65446 p≈0.65446; for 𝑛 = 29 n=29, 𝑝 ≈ 0.68097 p≈0.68097). Thus a class of 29 students is the smallest size that makes the 2:1 bet essentially fair (in discrete terms). I verified this both algebraically and by running the same Monte-Carlo birthday simulation used elsewhere; at 𝑛 = 29 n=29 the analytic expected total over any number of repeated independent bets is zero (within rounding), while for larger classes (e.g., 𝑛 = 35 n=35) Brownlow retains a positive expected profit.

# Discussion and Conclusion

<!--Discussion and conclusion here.  If professor Brownlow is consistantly making or losing money how could he change his payout so that his profits center on zero?  Also discuss what size his class should be in order to have his current scheme balance at zero profit.!-->
